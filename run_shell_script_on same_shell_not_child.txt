the reason is that your script spawns a new shell process as a child of the current shell. Any environment changes you make in the child process cannot affect the parent. When you use . or source, you are not spawning a new child process, you are running the commands in the current shel


You should source your script, with

. ./script
or

source ./script


echo $$   => to check current bash process id
